                <i>How do you ensure your classroom assessments are inclusive and meet the diverse needs of all your students? 
                    A new study in India has explored how teachers are assessing students with disability. In this article, 
                    Anannya Chakraborty shares findings from the study, and what they mean for teachers and school leaders. </i>
                    <br>
            <p>Research shows that formative assessments have a significant role in supporting the learning progress of all
                students. Based on assessment feedback, teachers can adjust instructions to address the learning area in which
                an individual student is not be performing well (Black & Wiliam, 1998). In the context of disability inclusion,
                teachers can adapt teaching practices and curriculum based on feedback from formative assessments (UNESCO,
                2019).
        
                In India, the National Education Policy (NEP) emphasises the importance of formative assessments to improve
                quality and equity in school education (Ministry of Human Resource Development, 2020). However, little evidence
                is available on how students with disability are included in formative assessments in Indian classrooms.
        
                Teachers have a central role in formative assessments, right from designing the tests to offering accommodations
                and an appropriate test environment. In our study, we looked at how teachers assess students with disability
                through formative assessments. The findings have been published in the Australasian Journal of Special and
                Inclusive Education (Swagat Kumar et al., 2024).</p>
                <h3>Making student assessments inclusive</h3>
                <p>
                    Depending on the specific needs of the learners, the following accommodations may be given to help them take the test:
                    
                    Reading out the questions and instructions.
                    Allowing for a scribe or device to record responses orally.
                    Permission to use Braille and assistive devices.
                    Given extra time.
                    Permission to use additional support materials, such as tables, logs, an abacus, calculator, or vocabulary lists.
                    Hints or picture cues to enable understanding the question or reduce cognitive load in recalling of facts needed for
                    answering.
                    Adjusting weightage to scoring guides/marking schemes, such as not penalising on grammar, spelling, or punctuation.
                    A different test environment, for example, a quiet place with no distractions.
                    
                    Modifications to a test: Modifying a standard assessment to test concepts at the level the learner is at.

                <h1>Preventing students' disruptive behaviour in the classroom</h1>

                <img width="775px" src="https://www.teachermagazine.com/assets/images/teacher/_articleimagetransform855x313/Preventing-disruptive-behaviour-in-the-classroom.jpg" alt="">
                <p>
                    Disruptive behaviour in the classroom makes it difficult for the teacher to teach and for other students to learn.
                
                    Dr Umesh Sharma is a Professor (Education) and Associate Dean (Equity and Inclusion) at Monash University in
                    Australia. He has led research in disability and inclusive education across several countries, including India,
                    Bangladesh, Canada, the United States, and Pacific Island nations such as Fiji, the Solomon Islands, Australia and
                    New Zealand.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why do children misbehave?</h3>
                <p>
                    Dr Sharma says revisiting a scene from the 2007 movie Taare Zameen Par, can help answer this question. In the film,
                    the teacher asks the student to read but he is unable to do so – the teacher insists the student makes another
                    attempt. The student starts making funny noises that infuriate the teacher and she decides to send the child out of
                    the classroom.
                    <u> ‘Disruptive behaviour is an indicator of students wanting to escape the learning environment or from a given task
                    which is too difficult or to draw attention. In the above instance, the student was misbehaving as he could not
                    participate in the task given to him,’ Dr Sharma tells Teacher.</u>
                   
                    He adds that most teachers, almost all the time, pay extra attention when children misbehave. They may leave their
                    tasks to tackle the behaviour or ask the child to stop misbehaving. He says this does more harm than good, as
                    children continue to misbehave to draw the teacher’s attention.
                
                    ‘Give attention to students when they behave properly, rather than when they misbehave,’ he advises. ‘For example,
                    they [teachers] can find another student who's sitting next to the student who's misbehaving, and say I really like
                    the way you're doing your work.’
                
                    He emphasises that teachers also need to contact parents when students are behaving well, rather than just when they
                    misbehave. Parents will then understand that the teacher is concerned about the child. ‘The problem is when you only
                    get a phone call once in a year [when the child misbehaves].’</p>
